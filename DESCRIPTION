Description: This package provides a Redis-based back-end for
    BiocParallel, enabling an alternative mechanism for distributed
    computation. The The 'manager' distributes tasks to a 'worker'
    pool through a central Redis server, rather than directly to
    workers as with other BiocParallel implementations. This means
    that the worker pool can change dynamically during job
    evaluation. All features of BiocParallel are supported, including
    reproducible random number streams, logging to the manager, and
    alternative 'load balancing' task distributions.
Depends: R (>= 4.2.0), BiocParallel (>= 1.29.12)
